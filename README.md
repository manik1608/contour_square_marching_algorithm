# Data
The dataset in this assignment is a 2D slice taken from a 3D Scalar field of a Hurricane Simulation Data. The variable is Pressure. If you want to know more about the original data, please refer to this link: http://vis.computer.org/vis2004contest/index.html

# Isocontour
Run the Isocontour.ipynb file, it will create a vtkPolyData object named polyline.vtp

# PolyLinePrint
After the creation of the polyline.vtp, you can show the results by running polylineprint.ipynb
